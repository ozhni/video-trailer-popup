      <h1>The Godfather</h1>
      <p>
        The Godfather "Don" Vito Corleone is the head of the Corleone mafia
        family in New York. He is at the event of his daughter's wedding.
        Michael, Vito's youngest son and a decorated WWII Marine is also present
        at the wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the
        family business. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who
        give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a
        powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's
        influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What follows is a clash
        between Vito's fading old values and the new ways which may cause
        Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob
        war against all the other mafia families which could tear the Corleone
        family apart.
